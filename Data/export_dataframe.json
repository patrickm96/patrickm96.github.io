Almost everyone I met has horror stories about being robbed at gunpoint, robbed by the police, and in one case even drugged and robbed by a taxi driver. It's not even safe to walk a short distance at night (locals told me to just take Uber). Beyond the security issues, scams also abound, and the covid policy is wacky, with hand sanitizer being forced on you everywhere you go (watch out: many of these products from Mexico contain toxic ingredients according to the FDA). Prices are similar to in Europe, yet security is much worse. In my book, that's a bad deal.

I strongly recommend a guided tour (about $75) because the trails aren't marked well and the guides are full of useful and interesting information. be prepared though, Cuenca is 2500m (8000 feet) up and Cajas is 4000m (13000 feet) up so you'll definitely feel the altitude.

Love the vintage stores and antique shops too. Sunsets on the lake are a treasure.   Gauchos are the most \"talkative\" people I've ever met in my life (and I am a world traveler who has lived in other countries). Being chatty isn't a bad thing, but the problem here is that the vast majority of people only talk about THEMSELVES. Oftentimes, non-stop. They don't ask questions about you because they have no interest. It's about showing off where they've eaten, traveled, studied, etc. Even the taxi and Uber drivers behave in this manner. Living in a city full narcissists \/ braggarts gets draining.  After years of being here, I've arrived at the conclusion that it's cultural (not malicious). Aside from this, they are very nice people. NOTE: In the countryside, the Gauchos tend to be polite, modest, and well-mannered.

It's a hotter town than Austin, not just in temperature, but also in terms of friendliness, activities, family values, and cultural richness (with authentic tacos of all types, Tex-Mex, Cali style, and from Mexico City), it has one of the best culinary and cocktail scenes in the country. It's one of the most affordable for millennials in the States with rich multicultural diversity, being predominantly Hispanic and inclusive. Many are bilingual in Spanish, but English is predominant as anywhere else in the States. From aviation (first military flight) to tech (the invention of the microprocessor), and even Hollywood (the first Best Picture), San Antonio has been home to many firsts. The spirit of these firsts has continued through the ages. Nowadays, there are incredibly fast internet speeds thanks to Google Fiber in many parts of town, San Antonio has all the ingredients for a booming creative economy due to a convergence of incentives in film, gaming, and traditional arts. Downtown San Antonio has old Spanish-architecture, mixed with colorful murals by local artists, and southern Texan charm, but it's the beautiful people who really make the town flourish.

If you want to genuinely experience the overall area or its history you'll want to visit both Ybor City and St Petersburg (First two areas that were initially settled). Clearwater is a tourist trap but has a beautiful manufactured beach (the sand as imported to make this beach what it is today).   Saint Petersburg, FL:  St Petersburg offers a few co-working spaces and at one time boasted the largest number of Kava Bars in a given city in the US (which are often used as cowork space by locals). The Brewery scene in St Petersburg is unmatched, with over 50 different breweries located in Pinellas County alone.   Nightlife: EDM\/Dance Music is primarily seen in Tampa\/Ybor City especially for harder genres like Dubstep\/Riddim and Drum & Bass, as well as Tech House. However, St Petersburg has a reputation for being the more artistic side of the Tampa Bay area and thus has a strong community for Techno and House music.   Daytime Fun: - Kayaking through the mangroves in Lido Key (Day trip) - 'Hiking' in Weedon Island Preserve - Daytime in Ybor City (great restaurants, bars, and a bit of history) - Busch Gardens Theme Park (Excellent rollercoasters) - Art walk in St Pete - Dali Museum (St Pete) - Fort Desoto  Cons: -5 years ago Tampa Bay was extremely affordable by all accounts, but is currently pacing to become much more expensive with a 25% increase in housing costs in the last year alone and one of the highest overall inflation rates in the country. -Traveling around Tampa Bay can become expensive due to the physical size of the city and how scattered things can be.

It's one of the best summers I have ever had in my life. The city is just amazing and offers dozens of outdoor activities. There are so many different places such as parks, lakes, hills, mountains, beaches, etc. Also, you can feel the Californication vibe on every step.  I lived in Hollywood and I would avoid this place at any cost. It's just too overrated and won't meet your expectations. Hollywood (esp. West Hollywood) is a big pile of dirtiness with people wandering around. I'd suggest looking for smaller neighborhoods preferably in The Valley. That area is just lovely. Also, anything close to Santa Monica is overwhelming yet too costly.  One of the things I also didn't like was the lack of cultural influence and this is for sure not a city that will offer nice architecture. Another thing I disliked was the huge social distancing towards foreigners which is most likely part of the American culture. If you were to make deeper friendships here, this is not a place to go. You will end up getting ignored and in the worst case, people will stop any contact with you.  Also, the public transport of LA is not reliable especially if you use bus transportation. Get ready to wait a long turn before you get to a bus. I suggest either using the metro or renting a car which is probably the best option in LA. Otherwise, get prepared for long walks throughout your place of stay.  With all of the above said, I will for sure return to this city again and can't say I'm not missing it.

Be aware that there are some generally bad spots in Las Vegas, but as long as you are within the strip, you will be safe. The things that I loved to do whenever going to Vegas is to try some popular restaurant or the bar and also staying in one of the hotels which is luxurious and one of it's kind.

But I've spent a lot of time in Windsor so I can provide some overview. Windsor is a border town across from Detroit, Michigan, USA. A lot of day-trippers visit from other areas of Ontario and Michigan to visit the Caesar's Casino, which is a very nice casino if you're into gaming. Other than that there's not much to do other than enjoy the views of the Detroit skyline from the riverwalk. I always feel safe in Windsor. Like most of Canada, Windsor is expensive, but internet service and other infrastructure are great for working. Winters are extreme. Some Canadians have anti-American attitudes, unfortunately.

But IMO worth the effort. You have to carry cash around and lots of bills as worth 1\/40th of what they were a few years ago. You can't really use cards anywhere, except dollar ATMs and some supermarkets.  Electricity mostly from generators, which have downtime a few hours a day. You need to check the daily hours of supply for the building before booking a place. 4G internet good 30+Mbps. Wired internet variable. Local SIM, I got a Touch Lebanon one with 20GB data for about $25\/month. Pricier if you buy at the airport. Airport close to city centre. $10-15 taxi fare. Uber and Bolt work but you must assign payment as cash and it will be more than the app says, because of the high downward volatility of the LBP currency. Some classier cafes or restaurants will take USD notes but mostly you need LBP.  Heaps of culture and history. Heaps of street art. A heartful people who have suffered insanely but still keep going, shows you the power of the human spirit to survive and thrive.

It's clean, safe, almost everyone was nice and helpful. 90% of people working here aren't Qatari but are from Philippines, Nepal, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. People aren't judgemental here but just minding their own own business, even if you're not muslim etc. The food quality is good. Even at a random museum you get fresh food. The only bad thing I can think of was the air quality, but we didn't really notice it except for it showing on the AQI apps that it was bad. Maybe it's just dust from the dust storms? Not sure. Airport is amazing and very new too. All buildings are very new and modern. Lots of activities like desert buggy driving, jetski'ing on water. I do wonder long term if you could live here as the expat scene might not be as big as Dubai.

You can also visit Federation Square which is a beautiful park on the edge of the CBD, and you can visit the Eureka Skydeck and Australia 108 which are the tallest buildings in Australia if you exclude the antenna from the Gold Coast's Q1 tower.

I've been in Cape Town for a month now and as a 24 yo woman traveling with 2 other friends I must say that I have never felt so unsafe. I stay in waterfront\/ green point which are relatively very safe neighborhoods, yet I  get stalked every day, both my friends have been robbed in a safe area around lunch time. We have to really watch out where we're walking and what we're wearing. I'd say the crimes are very easily avoided if you take an uber everywhere so you can go from your house to the beach by car, than from your house to table mountain by car etc. I'd say that looks do matter, as 3 tall slim blond girls we're probably the worst demographic to go here. Also if we walk together there are no issues at all, yet walking alone is not really an option. With the exception of a couple streets you can sort-of-safely cross. We've done some charity work on the other side of the city, as its really needed and the human suffering can't be described. All 3 of us have been traveling for 5-10 years and we really thought we'd seen it all. Yet we've never come across such difference: the suffering is next to the luxury and the poor basically sleep on the parking sports where rich people can't even leave their car (cause it will be stolen).  The food is amazing, the people are nice, the country is beautiful, its very cheap to live a very good life here, yet I would never recommend this place to any young woman traveling without a male partner or friend.

It's also not as 'sleepy' as everyone describes and not as cheap. Everyone knows each other and it's easy to dig into berber culture. Start with the taxi rank manager and ask about pretty much anything. Moroccan's love to help. You'll be sold weed every 10 meters, make of that what you will. Best things to do here are eat, surf and relax. Seems like a lot of construction and investment is going into this place so catch it while it's 'quiet'. I'd avoid staying on the main street as it's loud pretty much all the time with dogs barking, cats fighting, etc. I found Booking (website) to be the cheapest accommodation but nothing beats landing and getting stuck in to find a place for even cheaper. There is no bank machine in Taghazout. One in the Radisson nearby (when it works) and the next closest is Tamraght (I found one that doesn't charge). Sunny and chill. Fun if you like surfing and relaxing on the beach.","slug":"taghazout-morocco","short_slug":"taghazout","long_slug":"taghazout-morocco","users_count":3.0,"users_count_est":600.0,"users_count_been":123.0,"users_count_been_est":24600,"boost":null,"last_2_year_growth":333.3333333333,"name":"Taghazout","air_quality_now":33,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"30.5450072","longitude":"-9.7086375","country":"Morocco","country_code":"MA","country_slug":"morocco","state_code":"","state":"","internet_speed":5,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":4.8171428571,"humidity":"71","rank":62,"weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf25","temperatureC":"22","temperatureF":"71.89","temperatureC_feels_like":22,"temperatureF_feels_like":72,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":1487,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":966,"cost_for_local_in_usd":561,"cost_for_family_in_usd":1963.7916443601,"total_score":3.2783092429,"overall_score":3.2783092429,"cost_score":5.0,"internet_score":1.0789473684,"leisure_quality":"3","safety_level":4.0},{"region":"Africa","population":"148870","descriptionFromReview":"Mauritius is indeed a great place to live in as a Digital Nomad ! They have recently released the Premium Visa for digital nomads that allows to live on the island for at least 1 year (renewable). Best places to live in are the North (very well developed with all facilities and business centres) and the West of the island (more for those who prefer to surf the waves and hike the mountains in between 2 video calls !).   The Mauritians are very welcoming and smiling people. I am not the first one to be touched deeply by their generosity. Food is very nice, people are helping, music and culture are the best. Wind in the South is perfect for kite surfing, wind foil, windsurf, etc  There are also new coworking spaces opening all around the island and you can hop from The Hive coworking spaces to a nice South African caf\u00e9 such as Bloom in the North or to a tea place\/colonial house such as Les Aubineaux in the centre of the island. All with nice wifi and great vibes.   My personal recommendations : visit the tea factory of Bois Cheri, taste the Vanilla Rum of Saint-Aubin, hop in the beautiful lagoon of Pointe d'Esny, and hike Le Morne at sunrise. I cherish every single one of these visits.    I would also recommend to be accompanied by an agency to get your visa, find a trusted real estate agency, choose your local insurance, etc. I asked Smart Traveller, they are specialised in helping digital nomads come settle in Mauritius and they were the best. Young and friendly team, professional and human. Cannot recommend them enough actually.   Still a great adventure to be here in Mauritius working remotely and a dream come true for my family and I.

Pros: friendly people in the city (not so much in the far North rural areas of Rwanda if you travel on your own near Virunga). Clean air. A few good restaurants. Safe in the city (Kigali), even at night. Amazing wildlife and scenery\/landscapes if you get a place with a good view and some nature around. Government entities have their sh*t straight more than many other nations. Average internet. Stable power grid. Cons: dangerous near Virunga unless you go on a guided tour, water is unpotable and unsafe from the tap unless boiled even in Kigali, locals stare at you without interruption (not in a frightening way but it's uncomfortable), dangerous to navigate the traffic unless you're used to complete road chaos, slow\/poor service in restaurants, everyone asks you for money even the children in rural villages where tourists don\u2019t go, need a car\/motorcycle to do anything (not a walkable city), very poor selection of anything in terms of shopping needs and expensive.

The main city (Johannesburg CBD) is for the most part a no-go because of crime, but if you know some locals you should definitely check it out there are amazing restaurants, theatres and museums to experience there.   Having lived here for 30+ years, I'd recommend checking out Sandton CBD, restaurants in Linden, Wanderers and Bryanston, and  rent a car to drive out to The Cradle of Humankind, and visit the Maropeng museum there.

A few electric plugs and a very nice menu (finally a place serving other things than tagine or couscous) Delicious vegan options, fresh juices, great ambiance, comfy couches.","slug":"fes-morocco","short_slug":"fes","long_slug":"fes-morocco","users_count":null,"users_count_est":null,"users_count_been":74.0,"users_count_been_est":14800,"boost":null,"last_2_year_growth":null,"name":"Fes","air_quality_now":38,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"34.0197696","longitude":"-5.0163497","country":"Morocco","country_code":"MA","country_slug":"morocco","state_code":"","state":"","internet_speed":5,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":4.7028571429,"humidity":"72","rank":380,"weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf24","temperatureC":"20","temperatureF":"67.706","temperatureC_feels_like":21,"temperatureF_feels_like":70,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":1717,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1117,"cost_for_local_in_usd":585,"cost_for_family_in_usd":2046.3440906484,"total_score":2.8769214808,"overall_score":2.8769214808,"cost_score":4.752,"internet_score":1.1052631579,"leisure_quality":"4","safety_level":3.75},{"region":"Africa","population":"1056247","descriptionFromReview":null,"slug":"tunis-tunisia","short_slug":"tunis","long_slug":"tunis-tunisia","users_count":1.0,"users_count_est":200.0,"users_count_been":56.0,"users_count_been_est":11200,"boost":null,"last_2_year_growth":null,"name":"Tunis","air_quality_now":39,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"36.8064948","longitude":"10.1815316","country":"Tunisia","country_code":"TN","country_slug":"tunisia","state_code":"","state":"","internet_speed":4,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":4.68,"humidity":"70","rank":385,"weather_emoji":"\u2600\ufe0f","temperatureC":"20","temperatureF":"68.288","temperatureC_feels_like":21,"temperatureF_feels_like":70,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":1931,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1015,"cost_for_local_in_usd":524,"cost_for_family_in_usd":1835.5542316435,"total_score":2.8741824333,"overall_score":2.8741824333,"cost_score":4.5074285714,"internet_score":1.0092105263,"leisure_quality":"5","safety_level":3.9125},{"region":"Africa","population":"915101","descriptionFromReview":"I enjoyed the beaches in Diani, Kilifi, and Watamu.

It feels as easy as Canggu with more modern appointments to get by as a westerner a bit easier.","slug":"chiang-mai-thailand","short_slug":"chiang-mai","long_slug":"chiang-mai-thailand","users_count":33.0,"users_count_est":6600.0,"users_count_been":1735.0,"users_count_been_est":347000,"boost":null,"last_2_year_growth":208.2855280313,"name":"Chiang Mai","air_quality_now":93,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"18.7884898","longitude":"98.9861476","country":"Thailand","country_code":"TH","country_slug":"thailand","state_code":"","state":"","internet_speed":28,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":2.9457142857,"humidity":"58","rank":9,"weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf25","temperatureC":"31","temperatureF":"87.58","temperatureC_feels_like":35,"temperatureF_feels_like":95,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":1376,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1006,"cost_for_local_in_usd":706,"cost_for_family_in_usd":2472.7330756061,"total_score":3.6665706066,"overall_score":3.6665706066,"cost_score":5.0,"internet_score":5.0,"leisure_quality":"3","safety_level":4.140625},{"region":"Asia","population":"1768000","descriptionFromReview":"Just arrived in KL, we are 30\/35yrs+, a married couple and digital nomads, and wow..

Had a good time in Bengaluru ( formerly Bangalore). At first I stayed at the Parijatha Gateway Hotel, Near Soap Factory Metro, which was ideal for my purposes.  Transit & shopping was nearby, and there was a mall and good food.  The Metro in BLR is VERY modern and smooth- be prepared to be patted down (women and men separately) to get into the station, and you can but a metrocard at the ticket window.  In Bangalore the internet is VERY fast (it is India's Silicon Valley) and every other person is an engineer... and can chat you up in multiple languages.( their English may be better than yours :).  Uber works well inside the city, but I advise a pre-paid taxi from the airport to your hotel (as flagging down your Uber at the airport is a bit difficult because of the congestion there).  Now, lets talk about  traffic- I have lived in NYC and I can say with authority that, yes, Bangalore has the worst traffic congestion I have ever seen. Any time that Google maps gives you to get anywhere by Auto or bus in Bangalore can be Doubled or Tripled to get the actual time of transit- you can't make this sit up... I am not kidding. All that aside, I never felt unsafe in Bangalore.   Food in Bangalore is varied and tasty...  You will have a good variety of Vegetarian and non-vegetarian options available to you.  I did not seek out the night life, but there sure are some fancy upscale places if you want them.   My second stay ion the trip was at the Conrad Hilton, which is in a class all by itself but not your everyday Nomad kind of place (My expenses were being covered for that, the price per night is insanely low by western standards, and so if you need some amazing pampering for a night or two, this is your go-to place) .  Internet was fast, staff was attentive, scenery can't be beat. Uber back to the airport was easy.  I will return to Bengaluru in the future.","slug":"bengaluru-india","short_slug":"bengaluru","long_slug":"bengaluru-india","users_count":3.0,"users_count_est":600.0,"users_count_been":166.0,"users_count_been_est":33200,"boost":null,"last_2_year_growth":98.0818414322,"name":"Bengaluru","air_quality_now":59,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"12.9715987","longitude":"77.5945627","country":"India","country_code":"IN","country_slug":"india","state_code":"","state":"","internet_speed":33,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":4.2228571429,"humidity":"66","rank":13,"weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf27","temperatureC":"27","temperatureF":"80.95","temperatureC_feels_like":29,"temperatureF_feels_like":84,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":1314,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1110,"cost_for_local_in_usd":855,"cost_for_family_in_usd":2991.6865223194,"total_score":3.5651833468,"overall_score":3.5651833468,"cost_score":5.0,"internet_score":5.0,"leisure_quality":"2","safety_level":4.0},{"region":"Asia","population":"740000","descriptionFromReview":"Penang is really, really hot and humid.

Seminyak is not 'Balifornia' (Canguu), some will like it for that reason alone.   Traffic can get clogged in Seminyak but it's still far better than Canggu. Seminyak is just as commercialized as Canggu, but in a different way. If you're familiar with NY, Canggu has east village or lower east side vibes, while Seminyak is more soho.   Of course neither comes close to the actual NY neighborhoods. You could say Seminyak  is more polished with better infrastructure, so you'll find more sidewalks and high end artisan shops, while Canggu is like a super westernized village. Both areas are full of tourists, expats, and nomads, so you'll find plenty of good co working spaces, vegan cafes, and good coffee in Seminyak.  If you're trying to avoid mosquitos (and the gekkos they bring), there are definitely less in some parts of Seminyak, due to the infrastructure being more built up, although you still need to use repellent. Be alert to Seminyak scammers, they will spot you from a mile if you're western.  Thankfully my NY skills made it easy to avoid and\/or get rid of them. Seminyak has some of the best beachfront bars and cafes, with pools overlooking the sea, better than what you find in Canggu. Don't get me wrong, I still love Canggu, just not thrilled with what it's become, and Seminyak provides an escape that's just a grab or scooter ride away.  If you decide to check out Seminyak you need to dig to find the gems. Because on the surface it's pretty typical, but once you discover some of the amazing places there, you can create your own hideaway. It took me a few days and many hours of research, by foot and online, to find the best hidden places of Seminyak.

It's not really a community of its own, although that's changing as people move north from being priced out of the Canggu Airbnb market.  Seseh is built mostly on \"green land\", or land zoned for nature use rather than commercial or residential use. For this reason, land is scarce and rentals are quite expensive, with some Airbnb properties exceeding $6000 USD\/mo.   There is an enclave of expensive Airbnbs next to Seseh Beach which has nice homes. Good for a well-to-do family. Not worth it if you're single, as you will be quite isolated here and you'll need to drive ~25 minutes to get to Canggu proper.  WiFi speeds are slow and wifi coverage can be spotty. Don't recommend if you need low latency for your work.  Not a lot going on at night or during the day here. It's very quiet. Not a lot of shops, restaurants, or things to do other than the beach.

Definitely go and see Apopo - they train rats to find landmines and it's such a good initiative. I liked the lotus farm too.   Places to stay - would recommend the Bygone.

been in Las Palmas for two months (November and December). The climate was amazing, I could swim at Canteras Beach nearly every day. Yes, and there is a big digital nomad scene or community. On the other hand, residents are (at least in my opinion) not too friendly. As I speak Spanish very fluently (I personally come from Germany), I could figure out that many local people are jealous about our income (because most of us work in the IT and have a top income compared to Spanish employees) and about the fact that we can afford higher rents - consequently, we contribute to the increase of prices. At the beach, I could even follow a conversation between locals such as \"now due to the energy crisis, German people invade our island in order to save the high energy costs\". Besides, I didn't like the Canarian food too much, because in my opinion, it's too repetitive: grilled fish, grilled meat, potatoes with Mojo sauce - I was missing the skills and the finesse of the kitchen as you can find for example in France or in Italy. One outstanding point to emphasize: the Internet connection is brilliant, I had a 200 MB speed without any disruption.","slug":"gran-canaria-canary-islands-spain","short_slug":"gran-canaria","long_slug":"gran-canaria-canary-islands-spain","users_count":20.0,"users_count_est":4000.0,"users_count_been":562.0,"users_count_been_est":112400,"boost":null,"last_2_year_growth":108.7439613527,"name":"Gran Canaria","air_quality_now":21,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"28.1235459","longitude":"-15.4362574","country":"Spain","country_code":"ES","country_slug":"spain","state_code":"Canary Islands","state":"Canary Islands","internet_speed":23,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":5.0,"humidity":"87","rank":7,"weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf25","temperatureC":"19","temperatureF":"66.974","temperatureC_feels_like":19,"temperatureF_feels_like":66,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":1828,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1360,"cost_for_local_in_usd":782,"cost_for_family_in_usd":2738.4217881896,"total_score":3.7485958624,"overall_score":3.7485958624,"cost_score":4.6251428571,"internet_score":5.0,"leisure_quality":"4","safety_level":4.75},{"region":"Europe","population":"319279","descriptionFromReview":"I live in Timisoara since 2 years.

There are some good streets to walk. It never feels crowded, except the most touristic areas.  Architecture is interesting (but nothing to write home about) in a small touristic area, outside of it it's mostly ugly Soviet-era apartment blocks and ramshackle small houses. A couple of years ago the city was cheap, but now it's more expensive than many European cities and Asian capitals. When it was cheap, it was nice to stay there despite its drawbacks. Now it is very questionable. Drawbacks: - locals are somewhat unfriendly, nationalistic to quite high degree - they can either love you or hate you for nothing, and it happens in seconds - they drive like hell - food is the same in most places (though tasty) - low quality of everything: service, accomodations, goods etc. I'd say asian quality at european prices.

There are millions of refugees in this city against a registered population of 15 million. A significant number of asylum seekers do not have any registered documents and this creates various problems, so beware.  Nightlife is not recommended in Taksim. It is recommended that you prefer places such as Kad\u0131k\u00f6y or Be\u015fikta\u015f, Sar\u0131yer.  Some of the foreign women I met said that they felt very safe in this city.

There is no need for a car or a bus to move from one point to another in the city center. I've been working in Maakri area, which is local City. Really loved my time here, especially variety of quality food options available. My favourite upscale place to eat was FARM restaurant, which is a gem of a resto located in the beginning of Tallinn's Old Town. The restaurant is also the only provence style restaurant in the country, according to my understanding.","slug":"tallinn-estonia","short_slug":"tallinn","long_slug":"tallinn-estonia","users_count":3.0,"users_count_est":600.0,"users_count_been":448.0,"users_count_been_est":89600,"boost":null,"last_2_year_growth":47.8589885567,"name":"Tallinn","air_quality_now":100,"air_quality":null,"latitude":"59.4369608","longitude":"24.7535746","country":"Estonia","country_code":"EE","country_slug":"estonia","state_code":"","state":"","internet_speed":19,"air_quality_score":5,"air_quality_now_score":2.7857142857,"humidity":"85","rank":58,"weather_emoji":"\ud83c\udf25","temperatureC":"4","temperatureF":"38.68","temperatureC_feels_like":1,"temperatureF_feels_like":34,"cost_for_nomad_in_usd":2763,"cost_for_expat_in_usd":1961,"cost_for_local_in_usd":1194,"cost_for_family_in_usd":4180.5477559819,"total_score":3.2828335342,"overall_score":3.2828335342,"cost_score":3.5565714286,"internet_score":4.9355263158,"leisure_quality":"3","safety_level":4.0},{"region":"Europe","population":"790017","descriptionFromReview":"I quite liked Zagreb. People are fairly warm, and it's charmingly laid out. Lots of good cafes and restaurants, and the center is pretty walkable. As someone else said there are the commie block vibes, but those are in more peripheral neighborhoods. I felt it was safe, and had no issues getting around by tram mostly. As someone mentioned there is definitely the traditional Southern European cafes are for socializing, not working kind of vibe but still a decent number had wifi and didn't bat an eye at working all day.
